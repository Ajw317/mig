        <p>Imagine that it's 7am on a saturday morning, and someone just released a
        critical vulnerability for your favorite PHP application. The vuln is already
        exploited and security groups are releasing indicators of compromise. Your
        weekend isn't starting great, and the thought of manually inspecting thousands
        of systems isn't making it any better.</p>

        <p>MIG can help. The signature of the vulnerable PHP app (an md5 of a file, a regex
        on file, or just a filename) can be searches for across all your systems using
        the <code>file</code> module. Similarly, indicators of compromise such as specific log
        entries, backdoor files with {md5,sha{1,256,512,3-{256,512}}} hashes, IP
        addresses from botnets or signature in processes memories can be investigated
        using MIG. Suddenly, your weekend is looking a lot better. And with just a few
        command lines, thousands of systems will be remotely investigated to verify that
        you're not at risk.</p>

        <h2>Concepts</h2>
        <h3>Easy to deploy, easy to operate</h3>
        <p>MIG agents are designed to be lightweight, secure, and easy to deploy so you can
        ask your favorite sysadmins to add it to a base deployment without fear of
        breaking the entire production network. All parameters are built into the agent
        at compile time, including the list and ACLs of authorized investigators.
        Security is enforced using PGP keys, and even if MIG's servers are compromised,
        as long as our keys are safe on your investigator's laptop, no one will break
        into the agents.</p>

        <h3>Fast and asynchronous</h3>
        <p>MIG is designed to be fast, and asynchronous. It uses AMQP to distribute actions
        to endpoints, and relies on Go channels to prevent components from blocking.
        Running actions and commands are stored in a Postgresql database and on disk cache,
        such that the reliability of the platform doesn't depend on long-running processes.</p>

        <p>Speed is a strong requirement. Most actions will only take a few hundreds
        milliseconds to run on agents. Larger ones, for example when looking for a hash in
        a big directory, should run in less than a minute or two. All in all, an
        investigation usually completes in between 10 and 300 seconds.</p>

        <h3>Strong security primitives</h3>
        <p>Privacy and security are paramount. Agents never send raw data back to the
        platform, but only reply to questions instead. All actions are signed by GPG
        keys that are not stored in the platform, thus preventing a compromise from
        taking over the entire infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>MIG Action Format</h2>
        <p>
        Mozilla InvestiGator uses signed JSON actions that represent the investigation operation
        performed by a pool of agents.
        The JSON format is designed to be easy to read and easy to write without the help
        of a program. The long term goal is to allow investigators to share documents easily.

        <h3>Command Line</h3>
        <p>
        The command line is the primary interface of MIG Investigators. It provides
        the basic set of commands to create investigations, sign them, publish them to
        the API, and parse the results.
